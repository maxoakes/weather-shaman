# Weather Shaman

This repo is an archive of a project from my Spring 2022 Portland State University course. This project utilizes OpenWeather API and Google's Dialogflow to allow users to use voice or text in normal conversational language to get weather information for anywhere on Earth. Javascript (within a Node environment) was the only language used for this project.
